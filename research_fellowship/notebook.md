# Research notebook

I am, as of May 27, 2024 keeping a project notebook to record progress made on a daily basis.

I became Research Fellow at the Active Inference Institute thus the motivation for this notebook.

### Agency

* Sensor CAs receive predictions, read sense value if state, send prediction errors if prediction inaccurate
* Effector CAs initialized
* Can send messages to an eccector CA to actuate
* Can tell body interface to execute pending actuations

### Body

* Added sense value tolerance (i.e. accuracy of reading)
